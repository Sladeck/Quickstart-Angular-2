# QUICKSTART for Angular 2

This repo is a quickstart test to learn Angular 2.

I used the Angular.io tutorial to make it, follow this link to be redirect on the [official tutorial of Angular 2](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/).

## Install :

1. Download or clone the repo
2. npm install
3. npm start


> Don't forget to install plugins or take an IDE that correctly understand the **TypeScript** language.
